# This program was inspired by EGG tools such as praatdet, peakdet and PrEgg.  #
# I began developing this script after completing a fieldwork trip in Northern #
# Vietnam. The script extracts several glottal parameters from an EGG signal.  #
# Durations are calculated in seconds. Multiply by 1000 manually if millisecond#
# units are needed.                                                            #

# Methodology: Rothenberg method (Rothenberg & Mahshie, 1988), dEGG (Henrich   #
# et al., 2004), First central difference (Herbst et al., 2014) and hybrid     #
# approaches proposed by Howard (1995) and Henry Tehrani (2009).               #
# Processing speed: 45-50 (upto 80) files per minute.                          #
# Users can manually adjust methods and thresholds via the Settings window.    #
#                                                                              #
